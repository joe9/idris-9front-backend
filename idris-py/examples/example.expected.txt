Idris has got the following exciting features:
1. Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching
2. Simple foreign function interface (to C)
3. Compiler-supported interactive editing: the compiler helps you write code using the types
4. where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions, pattern matching let and lambda bindings
5. Dependent records with projection and update
6. Interfaces (similar to type classes in Haskell)
7. Type-driven overloading resolution
8. do notation and idiom brackets
9. Indentation significant syntax
10. Extensible syntax
11. Cumulative universes
12. Totality checking
13. Hugs style interactive environment
Total number of features: 13

thread A says 11024
thread B says 11024

And now, let's fail!
  -> (1) everything's fine: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root/hello'
  -> (2) everything's fine: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root/hello'
